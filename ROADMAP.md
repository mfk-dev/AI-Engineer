# To Become An AI-Engineer:
## There is going to be a lots of parts for this.

- Our roadmap works like this:
  - There is a README file named as "RESOURCES.md", there are the resource links of our roadmaps in there.
  - But, those roadmap links are not our main resources. Our main resource is Gemini AI.
  - I will keep on the Gemini's roadmap, and complete it.
  - ALso, i made the Gemini AI's roadmap a terminal with python, it is named as "main.py", you can check that, it is nice.
  - Everyday i work on the roadmap, i will save my process on the files, those files will be in the folder: "Progress".
