# To Become An AI-Engineer:
## There is going to be a lots of parts for this.

- Our roadmap works like this:
  - There is a README file named as "RESOURCES.md", there are the resource links of some of roadmaps in there.
  - Those roadmaps include a lots of academic thing, so our main resource is Gemini AI.
  - Gemini AI created an roadmap for me, and i've made that roadmap a terminal with Python.
  - That python terminal is named as "main.py"
  - Everyday i work on the roadmap, i will save my process on the files, those files will be in the folder: "Progress".
